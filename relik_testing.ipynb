Benchmarking is used to measure performance using a specific indicator (cost per unit of measure, productivity per unit of measure, cycle time of x per unit of measure or defects per unit of measure) resulting in a metric of performance that is then compared to others.  Also referred to as \\\"best practice benchmarking\\\" or \\\"process benchmarking\\\", this process is used in management in which organizations evaluate various aspects of their processes in relation to best-practice companies' processes, usually within a peer group defined for the purposes of comparison. This then allows organizations to develop plans on how to make improvements or adapt specific best practices, usually with the aim of increasing some aspect of performance. Benchmarking may be a one-off event, but is often treated as a continuous process in which organizations continually seek to improve their practices.  In project management benchmarking can also support the selection, planning and delivery of projects.  In the process of best practice benchmarking, management identifies the best firms in their industry, or in another industry where similar processes exist, and compares the results and processes of those studied (the \\\"targets\\\") to one's own results and processes.

Chromium is also the main additive in stainless steel, to which it adds anti-corrosive properties. Chromium is also highly valued as a metal that is able to be highly polished while resisting tarnishing. Polished chromium reflects almost 70% of the visible spectrum, with almost 90% of infrared light being reflected. The name of the element is derived from the Greek word \\u03c7\\u03c1\\u03c9\\u03bc\\u03b1, \\\"chroma\\\", meaning color, because many chromium compounds are intensely colored.  Ferrochromium alloy is commercially produced from chromite by silicothermic or aluminothermic reactions and chromium metal by roasting and leaching processes followed by reduction with carbon and then aluminium. Chromium metal is of high value for its high corrosion resistance and hardness. A major development in steel production was the discovery that steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form stainless steel. Stainless steel and chrome plating (electroplating with chromium) together comprise 85% of the commercial use.  In the United States, trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) ion is considered an essential nutrient in humans for insulin, sugar and lipid metabolism. However, in 2014, the European Food Safety Authority, acting for the European Union, concluded that there was not sufficient evidence for chromium to be recognized as essential.

For example, combining the metallic elements gold and copper produces red gold, gold and silver becomes white gold, and silver combined with copper produces sterling silver. Elemental iron, combined with non-metallic carbon or silicon, produces alloys called steel or silicon steel. The resulting mixture forms a substance with properties that often differ from those of the pure metals, such as increased strength or hardness. Unlike other substances that may contain metallic bases but do not behave as metals, such as aluminium oxide (sapphire), beryllium aluminium silicate (emerald) or sodium chloride (salt), an alloy will retain all the properties of a metal in the resulting material, such as electrical conductivity, ductility, opaqueness, and luster. Alloys are used in a wide variety of applications, from the steel alloys, used in everything from buildings to automobiles to surgical tools, to exotic titanium-alloys used in the aerospace industry, to beryllium-copper alloys for non-sparking tools. In some cases, a combination of metals may reduce the overall cost of the material while preserving important properties. In other cases, the combination of metals imparts synergistic properties to the constituent metal elements such as corrosion resistance or mechanical strength. Examples of alloys are steel, solder, brass, pewter, duralumin, bronze and amalgams.

It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust.  Pure iron is very rare on the Earth's crust, basically being limited to meteorites. Iron ores are quite abundant, but extracting usable metal from them requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1500\\u00a0\\u00b0C or higher, about 500\\u00a0\\u00b0C higher than what is enough to smelt copper. Humans started to dominate that process in Eurasia only about 2000 BCE, and iron began to displace copper alloys for tools and weapons, in some regions, only around 1200 BCE. That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. Iron alloys, such as steel, inox, and special steels are now by far the most common industrial metals, because of their mechanical properties and their low cost.  Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray. However, iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to give brown to black hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust.

Guillaume won the 1920 Nobel Prize in Physics for these discoveries, which shows how important these alloys were for scientific instruments.  Elinvar originally consisted of 52% iron, 36% nickel, and 12% chromium. It is almost non-magnetic, and corrosion resistant.  Other variations of the elinvar alloy are  The largest use of elinvar was in balance springs for mechanical watches and chronometers. A major cause of inaccuracy in watches and clocks was that ordinary steels used in springs lost elasticity slightly as the temperature increased, so the balance wheel would oscillate more slowly back and forth, and the clock would lose time. Chronometers and precision watches required complex temperature-compensated balance wheels for accurate timekeeping. Springs made of elinvar, and other low temperature coefficient alloys such as Nivarox that followed, were not affected by temperature, so they made the temperature-compensated balance wheel obsolete.\"}}, {\"text\": \"Forconi\", \"id\": 2336358, \"metadata\": {\"definition\": \"Forconi may refer to:\"}}, {\"text\": \"Equidimensional\", \"id\": 3478636, \"metadata\": {\"definition\": \"Equidimensional is an adjective applied to objects that have nearly the same size or spread in multiple directions.

Powers, the founder of perceptual control theory. Driesch and von Bertalanffy prefer this term, in contrast to \\\"goal\\\", in describing complex systems' similar or convergent behavior. Powers simply emphasised the flexibility of response, since it emphasizes that the same end state may be achieved via many different paths or trajectories. In closed systems, a direct cause-and-effect relationship exists between the initial condition and the final state of the system: When a computer's 'on' switch is pushed, the system powers up. Open systems (such as biological and social systems), however, operate quite differently.

The chemical is a propanoic acid in the class of amphipathic carboxylic acids. Most propanoic acid produced is consumed as a preservative for both animal feed and food for human consumption. One use for efaproxiral is to increase the efficacy of certain chemotherapy drugs which have reduced efficacy against hypoxic tumours, and can thus be made more effective by increased offloading of oxygen into the tumour tissues. No benefit was seen for efaproxiral in phase III clinical trials. The increased oxygenation of tissues could theoretically also produce enhanced exercise capacity in feline, rat and canine models for approximately 100 min. immediately after a high dosage 45 min. intravenous infusion. This has led World Anti-Doping Agency to categorise efaproxiral under a prohibited method to artificially enhance the uptake, transport or delivery of oxygen. There is no existing evidence that efaproxiral can effectively enhance performance in humans. Efaproxiral can be absorbed via transdermal, rectal, inhalation and gastrointestinal routes, though not at plasma concentrations great enough to alter the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve. Efaproxiral is explicitly excluded from the 2012 World Anti-Doping Agency list of Prohibited Substances and is explicitly included in the Prohibited Methods section M1 as a forbidden procedure to alter the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve in order to allosterically modify haemoglobin.\"}}, {\"text\": \"Atomically precise manufacturing\", \"id\": 3828521, \"metadata\": {\"definition\": \"Atomically precise manufacturing (APM) is the production of materials, structures, devices, and finished goods in a manner such that every atom has a specified location relative to the other atoms, and in which there are no defects, missing atoms, extra atoms, or incorrect (impurity) atoms.  Molecules are atomically precise objects and, as such, are essential building blocks in atomically precise manufacturing. Novel molecular designs can, themselves, be considered atomically precise products; for example, enzyme-like catalysts can be crafted to accelerate chemical reactions.  Beyond synthesis techniques to create single molecules, the key challenge of atomically precise manufacturing is in the assembly of molecular building blocks into larger and more complex objects that are also atomically precise. The two known methods for doing this are self-assembly and positional assembly. Molecules that have been designed or have evolved to bind together, typically along conformal surfaces, will self-assemble under the right conditions. In the production of atomically precise membranes, molecules can arrange themselves on the surface of a liquid and then be chemically bound to each other . Complex atomically precise self-assembled objects are also possible: striking examples include the robot-like Enterobacteria phage T4 and the bacterial flagellar motor . In these cases, free-floating \\\"parts\\\" (proteins) in solution self-assemble into three-dimensional objects. Self-assembly APM is experimentally accessible today.  In non-biological systems, the positional assembly (that is, the chemical binding) of a single atom to a single molecule was first demonstrated by Ho and Lee at Cornell University in 1999 using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) .\"}}, {\"text\": \"Empalme\", \"id\": 5715191, \"metadata\": {\"definition\": \"Empalme (Spanish: \\\"junction\\\", \\\"splice\\\", \\\"union\\\") may refer to\"}}, {\"text\": \"Ferroalloy\", \"id\": 2894974, \"metadata\": {\"definition\": \"Ferroalloy refers to various alloys of iron with a high proportion of one or more other elements such as manganese (Mn), aluminium (Al), or silicon (Si).

Prior to the synthesis of these substances, typical metal alloys comprised one or two major components with smaller amounts of other elements. For example, additional elements can be added to iron to improve its properties, thereby creating an iron based alloy, but typically in fairly low proportions, such as the proportions of carbon, manganese, and the like in various steels. Hence, high entropy alloys are a novel class of materials. The term \\u201chigh-entropy alloys\\u201d was coined because the entropy increase of mixing is substantially higher when there is a larger number of elements in the mix, and their proportions are more nearly equal.  These alloys are currently the focus of significant attention in materials science and engineering because they have potentially desirable properties. Furthermore, research indicates that some HEAs have considerably better strength-to-weight ratios, with a higher degree of fracture resistance, tensile strength, as well as corrosion and oxidation resistance than conventional alloys. Although HEAs have been studied since the 1980s, research substantially accelerated in the 2010s.\"}}, {\"text\": \"Metal\", \"id\": 4689830, \"metadata\": {\"definition\": \"A metal (from Greek \\u03bc\\u03b5\\u03c4\\u03b1\\u03bb\\u03bb\\u03bf\\u03bd \\\"metallon\\\", \\\"mine, quarry, metal\\\") is a material that, when freshly prepared, polished, or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). A metal may be a chemical element such as iron, or an alloy such as stainless steel.  In physics, a metal is generally regarded as any substance capable of conducting electricity at a temperature of absolute zero. Many elements and compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metallic under high pressures. For example, the nonmetal iodine gradually becomes a metal at a pressure of between 40 and 170 thousand times atmospheric pressure. Equally, some materials regarded as metals can become nonmetals. Sodium, for example, becomes a nonmetal at pressure of just under two million times atmospheric pressure.  In chemistry, two elements that would otherwise qualify (in physics) as brittle metals\\u2014arsenic and antimony\\u2014are commonly instead recognised as metalloids, on account of their predominately non-metallic chemistry. Around 95 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals (or are likely to be such). The number is inexact as the boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved.

Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, it is a major component used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, automobiles, machines, appliances, and weapons.  Iron is the base metal of steel. Iron is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic and face centered cubic, depending on its temperature. In the body-centered cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the center and eight atoms at the vertices of each cubic unit cell; in the face-centered cubic, there is one atom at the center of each of the six faces of the cubic unit cell and eight atoms at its vertices. It is the interaction of the allotropes of iron with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties.  In pure iron, the crystal structure has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another, and so pure iron is quite ductile, or soft and easily formed. In steel, small amounts of carbon, other elements, and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that are common in the crystal lattices of iron atoms.

It involves heating a material above its recrystallization temperature, maintaining a suitable temperature for a suitable amount of time, and then cooling.  In annealing, atoms migrate in the crystal lattice and the number of dislocations decreases, leading to a change in ductility and hardness. As the material cools it recrystallizes. For many alloys, including carbon steel, the crystal grain size and phase composition, which ultimately determine the material properties, are dependent on the heating rate and cooling rate. Hot working or cold working after the annealing process alter the metal structure, so further heat treatments may be used to achieve the properties required. With knowledge of the composition and phase diagram, heat treatment can be used to adjust from harder and more brittle to softer and more ductile.  In the cases of copper, steel, silver, and brass, this process is performed by heating the material (generally until glowing) for a while and then slowly letting it cool to room temperature in still air. Copper, silver and brass can be cooled slowly in air, or quickly by quenching in water, unlike ferrous metals, such as steel, which must be cooled slowly to anneal. In this fashion, the metal is softened and prepared for further work such as shaping, stamping, or forming.\"}}, {\"text\": \"Ferromagnetism\", \"id\": 4803486, \"metadata\": {\"definition\": \"Ferromagnetism is the basic mechanism by which certain materials (such as iron) form permanent magnets, or are attracted to magnets.

Substances respond weakly to magnetic fields with three other types of magnetism\\u2014paramagnetism, diamagnetism, and antiferromagnetism\\u2014but the forces are usually so weak that they can only be detected by sensitive instruments in a laboratory.

These alloys are most commonly die cast. Zamak alloys (particularly #3 and #5) are frequently used in the spin casting industry.  A large problem with early zinc die casting materials was zinc pest, owing to impurities in the alloys.
